   <br><br>
    1. Know where to go. If you are ordered to evacute, know the local hurricane evacuation route(s)
      to take and have a plan for where you can stay. Contact your local emergency management agency
      for more information.
   <br>
    2. Put together a go-bag: disaster supply kit, including a flashlight, batteries, cash, first aid
      supplies, medications, and copies of your critical information if you need to evacuate.
   <br>
    3. If you are not in an area that is advised to evacuate and you decide to stay in your home, plan
      for adequate supplies in case you lose power and water for several days and you are not able to
      leave due to flooding or blocked roads.
   <br>
    4. Make a family emergency communication plan.
   <br>
    5. Many communities have text or email alerting systems for emergency notifications.  To find out
      what alerts are available in your area, search the Internet with your town, city, or county name
      and the word "alerts".

    1. Identify safe rooms built to FEMA criteria or ICC500 storm shelters or other
      potential protective locations in sturdy buildings near your home, work, and other
      locations you frequent so you have a plan for where you will go quickly for safety
      when there is a Warning or an approaching tornado. <br>
    2. For schools, malls, and other buildings with long-span roofs or open space plans, or many
      occupants, ask the building manager to identify the best available refuge. <br>
    3. Build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan. <br>
    4. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or to commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest
      information.  In any emergency, always listen to the instructions given by local emergency
      management officials. <br>
    5. Be alert to changing weather conditions.  Look for approaching storms. <br>
    6. Look for the following danger signs:<br>
      -Dark, often greenish sky<br>
      -Large hail<br>
      -A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)<br>
      -Loud roar, similar to a freight train. <br>
      -If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared
       to take shelter immediately.
